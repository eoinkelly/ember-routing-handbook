# Ember routing handbook

## Introduction

Hello friend and welcome to a deep dive into how the Ember routing layer works.

The ember router is considered "best in class" - it is one of those ideas that the other JS frameworks are taking inspiration from (in the same way that Ember is inspired by them).

### Automatic code generation is not (yet) our friend

Ember has a really neat "automatic code generation" feature i.e. if Ember can infer that an object needs to exist and you don't specify it in your code then Ember will create an instance of it that implements some default behaviour for you. If you are in the "I don't quite get Ember yet" part of your career (hopefully a reasonably short period) then this feature is not useful and will get in the way of your understanding. When you graduate into the ["It's an Ember system, I know this!"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFUlAQZB9Ng) part of your career (a much longer period of time) then automatic code generation is your friend again.

We are going to be explicit about code in this guide - no magic tricks.
